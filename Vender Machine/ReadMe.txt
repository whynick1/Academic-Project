Using src/com/Intuit/view/Application to run

Technique used:
1.Use factory method to make add new kind of product and vender machine easy.
2.Use reflact, one of the example is in com.Intuit.domain.vender.MultiFunctionVender

This system implements following functions:

2.Support different payment method (coin, cash, credit)
3.Mock the machanical motor
4.Support different type of motor, Motor interface can be used to add new motor in the future.
5.Vender's sale can be checked 

Note:
Because I don't have much time to do this, so finish it in a hurry, just simply test it, not use Junit. Don't have
enough time to test all the cases and write annotation for every function, sorry about that. If you have questions
